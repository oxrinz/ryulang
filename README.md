Reimagining what machine learning development workflow should look like
</div>

---

I believe there should be an attempt at making a programming language that recognizes, and respects the fact that machine learning is its own programming paradigm. Restricting users to non-turing completeness provides numerous benefits both development experience, and optimization wise.

ryu! is not only a programming language, it's a toolkit. It empowers users beyond syntax, providing a built in dashboard, a powerful language server along with other innovative features. It aims to be the framework, with which [writing theoretically most efficient](https://medium.com/@noahbean3396/the-future-of-ai-compute-deepseeks-ptx-innovation-and-what-it-means-for-nvidia-f501b7a0f58e) code is easiest, and fastest.

Currently under heavy development, first prototype this summer... hopefully.
