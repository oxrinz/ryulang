ryu! is not only a programming language, it's a framework, toolkit, a suite. It empowers users beyond syntax, providing a built in dashboard filled with easily accessible, (without going into the details) useful information. It aims to be the framework, with which [writing theoretically most efficient](https://medium.com/@noahbean3396/the-future-of-ai-compute-deepseeks-ptx-innovation-and-what-it-means-for-nvidia-f501b7a0f58e) code is easiest, and fastest.

Currently under heavy development, first prototype this summer... hopefully.
