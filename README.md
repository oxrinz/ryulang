yet another abandoned project
</div>

the idea was to create a fully transparent compiler that respects the fact that machine learning is its own programming paradigm, providing various tools at compile time that other compilers would not be able to do. i still like the ideas i had, i will probably go back to this from time to time, but after pouring a few months worth of work into it the realization that making a compiler, especially in a systems level language like zig, alone, is a 5+ year job. if i still fully believe in it after a year, i will come back to it

notes

188 = kernel is fucked, i don't know where this error code is documented
